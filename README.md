# Diceobu
An open source Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game Tool

You can compile the source code on your own by opening the .sln file with Visual Studio (or the .pro file with Qt Creator)

If you want to download the executable all your have to do is download the Diceobu.zip folder, unzip it and run the .exe file (do NOT change, remove, or otherwise interfere with the files inside the executable's directory, the .exe needs them in order to run properly).
